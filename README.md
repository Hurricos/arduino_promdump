An Arduino MEGA sketch for dumping old PROMs chips.


Currently supported chips:
82s123, 82s129, 82s141, 6348, 6349, mb7054, mb7123


Check the *.hpp files for pin configuration for each device.


Use the Arduino IDE serial console for text based dumping or the included linux console tool to save binary dumps.
